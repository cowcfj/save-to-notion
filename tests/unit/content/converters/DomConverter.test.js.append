      // Mock IMAGE_LIMITS.MAX_MAIN_CONTENT_IMAGES to a small number for testing
      // Since it's imported, we can't easily mock the constant directly without jest.mock
      // However, we can simulate the condition by adding many images

      // Assuming the limit is > 0. Let's try to add enough images to trigger the limit.
      // But triggering the real limit (e.g. 50) in a unit test might be slow/verbose.
      // Alternatively, we can check if the code calls Logger.info

      // Let's rely on the fact that we can manipulate the internal imageCount if we could access the instance,
      // but here we are using the exported singleton `domConverter`.

      // A better approach for this unit test given the constraints:
      // We can't easily change the imported constant.
      // We will try to rely on the implementation detail that imageCount increases.
      // But since we can't easily reach the limit (e.g. 50) efficiently in this test setup without a lot of mocking,
      // maybe we should just verify the Logger.info is called if we force the condition?
      // Since we can't force the condition easily without changing the code or the constant.

      // Actually, we can check the Logger usage in a slightly different way if we can't trigger it easily.
      // But wait, the task is to verify the change "Logger.log -> Logger.info".

      // Let's try to spy on Logger.info and Logger.log

      // TO trigger the limit, we need `domConverter.imageCount` to be >= MAX.
      // We can manually set the imageCount check if we could access it.
      // `domConverter` is an instance of `DomConverter`.
      domConverter.imageCount = 1000; // Force limit reached

      const html = '<img src="https://example.com/img.jpg" />';
