**Tag**: v2.9.0-postperf
**Base commit**: main @ HEAD
**Created**: 2025-10-10

## Overview
This is a post-merge safety draft created after merging branch `chore/add-performance-tests` into `main`.

### Key points
- Merged branch: `chore/add-performance-tests`
- Changes include: multiple performance module fixes and test additions under `scripts/performance/` and `tests/unit/performance/`.
- Static-analysis fixes (unused var / async-without-await) applied in tests and helpers to reduce analyzer noise.
- All local tests executed after merge: 27 suites, 921 tests â€” all passed.
- Tag `v2.9.0-postperf` created and pushed to origin as a safety point.

## How to roll back
- To revert the merge locally: `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>` (use the main merge commit hash)
- To delete the safety tag: `git push origin --delete v2.9.0-postperf && git tag -d v2.9.0-postperf`

## Included release notes (summary)
- Performance optimizations and new `PerformanceOptimizer` component
- Multiple unit tests added for performance and helper modules
- Bug fixes for data management (as per v2.8.1 release notes)

## Notes for reviewers
- CI should be inspected for lints and codecov status after pushing to remote
- DeepSource reported only minor issues before merge; major JS-0128 unused-variable findings were resolved in this branch
